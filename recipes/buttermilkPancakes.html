        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Flour</strong>: All-purpose flour contains gluten, which gives the buttermilk pancakes structure and pleasant chewiness.<strong> 3 cups all-purpose flour</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Sugar</strong>: Just three tablespoons ofwhite sugar should be enough to lend subtle sweetness. Remember, you'll be adding a lot more sugar if you top the pancakes with syrup or molasses! <strong> 3 tablespoons white sugar</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Leaveners</strong>: Baking powder and baking soda act as leaveners (a substance that releases gas when mixed with other ingredients, causing the batter to rise to fluffy perfection).<strong> 3 teaspoons baking powder AND 1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Salt</strong>: You definitely don't want to skip adding a small amount of salt â€” the buttermilk pancakes will taste bland without it.<strong> 3/4 teaspoon salt</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Buttermilk</strong>: Of course, you'll need buttermilk for buttermilk pancakes! This recipe calls for three whole cups.<strong> 3 cups buttermilk</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Milk</strong>: Wholemilk helps create the perfect batter consistency and cuts some of the buttermilk's acidity.<strong> 1/2 cup milk</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Eggs</strong>: Three whole eggs add structure and rich flavor to the buttermilk pancakes.<strong> 3 eggs</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Butter</strong>: Melted butter lends flavor and keeps the pancakes nice and moist.<strong> 1/3 cup butter, melted</strong></li>

        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. Beat together buttermilk, milk, eggs, and melted butter in a separate bowl. Keep the two mixtures separate until you are ready to cook.</li>
            <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat. You can flick water across the surface and if it beads up and sizzles, it's ready.</li>
            <li>Pour the wet mixture into the dry mixture; use a wooden spoon or fork to mix until it's just blended together. The batter will be a little lumpy which is what you want.</li>
            <li>Pour or scoop the batter onto the preheated griddle, using approximately 1/2 cup for each pancake. Cook until bubbles appear on the surface, 1 to 2 minutes; flip with a spatula and cook until browned on the other side. Repeat with remaining batter.</li>
            <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
