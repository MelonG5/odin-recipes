        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Flour</strong>: All-purpose flour gives the banana bread structure. <strong> 2 cups all-purpose flour</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Baking soda</strong>: Baking soda acts as a leavener, which means it helps the banana bread rise.<strong> 1 teaspoon baking soda</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Salt</strong>: A pinch of salt enhances the overall flavor, but it won't make the loaf taste salty.<strong> 1/4 teaspoon salt</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Butter</strong>: A stick of butter lends richness, moisture, and irresistible flavor.<strong> 1/2 cup butter</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Banana</strong> Of course, you'll need bananas! Choose overripe bananas. <strong> 2 1/3 cups mashed overriped bananas</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Eggs</strong>: Eggs act as a binding agent, which means they hold the batter together.<strong> 2 large eggs, beaten</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Brown sugar</strong>: Brown sugar sweetens things up and adds a hint of warmth.<strong>3/4 cup brown sugar</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan.</li>
            <li>Combine flour, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. Beat brown sugar and butter with an electric mixer in a separate large bowl until smooth. Stir in eggs and mashed bananas until well blended. Stir banana mixture into flour mixture until just combined. Pour batter into the prepared loaf pan.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 60 minutes. Let bread cool in pan for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
