This project is about creating a simple recipe website using HTML.
Using basic knowledge about HTML to do so which includes images and formatting text.

After finishing all 3 recipes I've learned how to link multiple html files together and setting up the directories correctly. I've also got more time to work with images in HTML.

Note: All the recipes where pulled from allrecipes on their site.
